Hello and welcome! You've made it to my personal website/blog. I'll be using this platform as a channel to highlight some of my skills as a software engineer and to hopefully introduce some insightful blog posts about technology and anything else I feel like.


I likely won't be posting all that often, as I'm still busy finishing up school at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse and working as a software engineer at Trane. My intention is to make occasional, insightful blog posts for anything I might be interested in, so stay tuned and have great day!
