<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
Hello, I'm Quentin - a developer, among other things. My passion for problem solving sparked when I first started programming at the age of 15. Since then, I’ve broadened my developer profile from writing C++ games to implementing large-scale software projects for mechanical engineers to use across multiple site locations. I’ve undertaken development projects ranging from a scheduling application for a CS class to contributing to enterprise-level UI libraries. I’ve had a lot of fun participating in the ACM NCNA Regional Programming Contests. I’ve also had the great opportunity to work on an undergraduate research project at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse involving AI techniques in pair with a biological/conservational problem regarding the Chestnut Blight Fungus.
